i'm rishi. i write code for Arterial, a company that automates decision-making for policy-driven organizations. we've closed a small pre-seed round with the world's top operators, and are in the hands of the largest planning firms in the great lakes corridor.

before that, I raised $1.8M for otto, a pet-tech startup i co-founded in my freshman year that scaled to tens of thousands of customers; i ran a hackathon on a train; i guest lectured at a few places; and wrote tooling for financial platforms that scaled to hundreds of millions in txn's. there's a lot more, but you can look at rishi.cx for that.
