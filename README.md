I'm [Rishi](https://rishi.cx) üåå, a high school sophomore that's super interested in open-source development, startups, React, and everything in between! ‚ú®‚ö°Ô∏è

I'm primarily a JS/TS dev, but I've worked with Rust üî•, C++ üíñ, Haskell ‚ö°Ô∏è, and Swift üèé in the past.

I'm currently working as the Chief Executive Officer over at [Banur](https://github.com/banurapp), a software engineering intern at Makasu, the president of TFSS Hack Club, and the lead software architect at PetCode.

Whenever I'm not contributing to [Deta](https://deta.sh), [Exercism](https://exercism.io), [Standard Structure](https://github.com/Standard-Structure), or various other repositories, I love to mountain bike with my Talon 3 on some of the trails near my house, build stupid projects, and just have fun with my friends!

You can find me on the Hack Club Slack posting too much for my own good as `@ricey`, Instagram as `@rishi.svg`, Linkedin as `@heyrishi`, and Twitter as `@rishiosaur`!
