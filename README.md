### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

![Me at Hack the North 2018]()

I'm Rishi, a rising HS sophomore that's super interested in open-source development, startups, React, and everything in between.

Whenever I'm not contributing to [Deta](), [Exercism](), [Standard Structure](), or various other repositories, I love to mountain bike with my Talon 3 on some of the trails near my house, build stupid projects, and just have fun with my friends!

You can find me on the Hack Club Slack posting too much for my own good as `@ricey`, Instagram as `@rishi.svg`, Linkedin as `@heyrishi`, and Twitter as `@rishiosaur`!
